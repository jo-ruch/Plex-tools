# Plex tools
Just a collection of tools I made for managing Plex Media Server under Debian.

## plex_scan.sh
Automatic scanning on Debian works a bit sporatic. Run this script to imidiately scan for new files.

## update_plex.sh
Update Plex to the latest available version. Replace `YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN` with an active Plex token for your account.
